# aptos-indexer

ported over from https://github.com/lithdew/aptos-indexer

> [!WARNING]  
> We use a hardcoded version of `aptos-proto` because only that version has the most up to date proto definition.
> We will release an offical version of `aptos-proto` soon, for now just don't change the `aptos-proto` version in `package.json`.
